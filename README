How to compile

AnyMemo is built using gradle. You need to make sure the following are installed in
order to build:
* Android SDK tools: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
* JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

In Android SDK tools' "Android SDK Manager", you need the following items:
* Android 4.1.x SDK platform
* Android SDK tools
* Andoird SDK Build-tools version 19
* Android support repository
* Android support library

Once the dependency is satisfied, you need to set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable
to the Android SDK installation location. E. g.

$ export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk-linux/

cd to the AnyMemo directory and Use gradle to compile the project
$ cd anymemo
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug

The build artifacts are in
build/apk/

Eclipse users
-------------

For the eclipse user, the gradle is not supported to build. However you can
still use eclipse to build the project.

* Import project in eclipse
* Import the library project in eclipse-deps/appcompat/
* In AnyMemo project's property, "Java Build Path", add "aspectjrt.jar" in libraries

Known issue:
The aspectj will not work correctly.

Android studio user
-------------------

It is easy! Install all the dependencies listed in the "How to compile" section
and you can import directly into Android studio.
